# Learningcpp

This repository will have different programs as I go through the C++ learning process

The structure is going to be in the following way:

I will use as a learning base the book called "C++: From Control Structures through Objects - Eight Edition ".

The things that are going to be documented here are:
  - Programs and codes per chapter, as I work with them.
  - Projects recommended by the book or something comes in my mind to create in the process.

[Here are the Chapters](https://github.com/curet/Learningcpp/tree/master/Chapters):
  - [Introduction to C++](https://github.com/curet/Learningcpp/blob/master/Chapters/1_Introduction.cpp)

[Here are the Projects](https://github.com/curet/Learningcpp/tree/master/Projects) (which are going to be in a directory with the same name of the chapter inspired them or come from):
  - Introduction to C++
